# Tic Tac Toe

In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
Players will soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. 

## How do we play Tic Tac Toe?

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are player X, second player is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
