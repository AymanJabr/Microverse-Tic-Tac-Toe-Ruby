# Tic Tac Toe

In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
Players will soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. 

## How do we play Tic Tac Toe?

Players take turns playing: 
- 1st turn ‚Äî Player 1: 
Player 1 places their token (X) in only 1 square of their choice
- 2nd turn ‚Äî Player 2:
 Player 2 places their token (O) in only 1 square of their choice, except they can‚Äôt touch the square that Player 1‚Äôs token already fills
- 3rd turn- Player 1 ‚Ä¶. and the cycle continues until a player wins or there‚Äôs a tie game

There are 8 winning combinations: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row, Left column, Middle column, Right column, Left diagonal, and Right diagonal
There‚Äôs a draw/tie when the entire board is filled with X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs but no winning combinations can be found.
